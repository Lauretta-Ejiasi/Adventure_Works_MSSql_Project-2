# Adventure_Works_MSSql_Project-2

The Adventure Works database was used for this project.

This SQL project demonstrates my ability to perform SQL queries and statements that can be used to manipulate and analyze data in different scenarios. The project covers the following topics:
- Selecting columns from tables
- Using aliases to rename columns
- Removing duplicates from query results
- Sorting query results using the ORDER BY clause
- Using the BETWEEN operator to filter data within a range
- Using the NOT BETWEEN operator to filter data outside a range
- Using the IN operator to filter data based on a list of values
- Performing joins between tables to combine data from different sources
- The project also includes an example of creating a new schema and tables within it, inserting data into the tables, and performing a SELECT query to retrieve data from one of the tables.
